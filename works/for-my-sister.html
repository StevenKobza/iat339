            <h1>For My Sister Process Analysis</h1>
            <p>For my first process analysis I wanted to focus on my video project from IAT 202 - Moving Images
                because it showcases how well my team and I went from a rough draft into a more comprehensive story. 
                At first all that we knew we wanted to do was have two sisters where one wasnâ€™t real. 
                That was the beginning of our story. From there, we started thinking more about how there 
                needed to be some ability for time to pass and for the audience to get to know our characters.</p>

                In these slides, you will see two of the photos that we had included on the wall in the intro to the film. 
                Each one of those shots was taken by us to be included in the film. They were all taken in one day but they
                had to convey time passing so we had the actresses change clothes throughout the different shots.
                <br><br>
                The other sets of images are the behind the scenes images, they're ones that show how we had things set up and 
                how things looked before we ended up filming and colour correcting them. They also show how much fun we had while
                creating this project.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br>
                During this project, I learned that not everything ends up going the way that you want them to 
                and you need to be able to adjust your goals and your schedule. We had multiple delays in filming
                and these things were accounted for by us and we were able to work around them. We ended up with a
                film that I'm very proud of.
