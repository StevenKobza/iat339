            <h1>Plagiarism Campaign Process Analysis</h1>
            <p>For this second process analysis, 
                I wanted to focus on something that’s more solid and 
                something that required teamwork again because I find that teamwork showcases the best 
                in what people work on. So, for this one I decided to go with my IAT 103W campaign posters. 
                This work was done in a team where we all worked together to come up with an idea as well as 
                figure out how we’re going to implement it in such a way that it all makes sense. 
                We were given the task of designing a poster about citation. I had an idea to focus on 
                pro-citation rather than anti-plagiarism because positive reinforcement tends to 
                go over better than negative. </p>
            <img class = "img-fluid border rounded mx-auto d-block" src = "../img/citationIdea.png" alt = "citation poster ideas">
            <br>
            <p>
                Provided here are some of the ideas that we came up with as well as some brief ideation. 
                Further on in this document there are more items. One of the things that we all 
                agreed on though is that we wanted something simplistic and we wanted something that would draw the eye of people.

                <br><br>One of the things that we were also thinking about is some sort of 
                “gamification” to make reading the posters more enjoyable and easier to look at 
                because it removes text. We also wanted to have some sort of quote from a movie or
                some play on a famous quote from a movie due to its immediate recognition as well as
                its ability to connect with different parts of the brain.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br>
                In this project, I learned how to work together with people who I never knew before and how to make posters work well.
                These things helped me be able to come up with ideas that are useful and helpful for the topic that we need to focus on.
