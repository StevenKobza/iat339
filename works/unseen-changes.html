            <p>
                This project is my most recent creation. It was created during my Moving Images course during the Fall 2020 semester. 
                I found myself working on it alone, and as such I needed to develop a couple of very important skills that are used whenever creating your own film.
            </p>
            <p>
                I found myself reaching into the bag of tricks that was created whenever I took part in Digital Image Design a couple of years ago, I remembered how to create a camera that moves across the screen.
                And I used that to create the panning effect that is present in my film.
            </p>
            <br>
            <img src = "../img/pan.png" alt = "panning in after effects" class = "img-fluid">
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                I also found myself needing to work on iterating my project versus just restarting multiple times over and over again. As such here is one of my earlier drafts before I settled on some things.

                One of the things that I found myself struggling with most was creating a cohesive narrative. It's something that I usually end up struggling with, because I can take high quality photos but they're not always the most impressive
                or don't leave the lasting impact that I wanted. So in that case I ended up relying more on After Effects and such to help me through this project. I would like to really thank Kate Hennessy and Doenja Oojges for their help and 
                their amazing teaching throughout this class. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                While working alone, I found it harder to stay motivated on the project at hand and the final outcome because I didn't necessarily have anyone else there to contribute ideas and I find myself struggling whenever it comes down to just me.
                I had a large amount of gear at home at my disposal, but I don't feel like I was able to put it to the best use and instead I found that I was just putting together something that didn't really showcase the full potential of what was possible.
            </p>
            <h2>Finalized Version</h2>
            <p>After getting a well needed extension from Kate and Doenja, I was able to go back and make some changes to my film in such a way that I hope the story makes more sense. I also was able to focus more on the traveling aspect as I felt that
                was the portion of my film that got left out due to me feeling overwhelmed in my school work.
