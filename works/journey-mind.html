                In this project, we were given very little direction as to what we needed to do, we were just told
                that we need to have multiple different endings and there needed to be choices for the user to make.
                We used a visual novel game that allows for narration to come through easily but also allowed for a bunch
                of choices easily. Unity was used for this game as well. We ended up struggling a bit with some of the ideation
                but came together to end up with this project.
