            <p class = "lead">I am Steven Kobza, an Interactive Arts and Technology student at Simon Fraser University, 
                my main interests are in programming and videography. I find myself gravitating 
                towards websites where everything is laid out in front of me in such a way that 
                it doesn’t feel like that designer doesn’t value my intelligence. As such I find myself 
                focusing more on function rather than form because I care about how easy it is for someone 
                to find the stuff they’re looking for; over an unnecessarily complex user interface 
                that was just created to look pretty.</p>
